# Hotel-revenue-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand trends and performance metrics. The analysis utilizes SQL and Power BI to extract insights from a historical dataset. Key findings include revenue trends, ADR analysis, occupancy analysis, and car space utilization. The project also provides recommendations for future improvements in pricing, capacity planning, and marketing strategies.
## Project Steps:

1. Data Acquisition and Preparation:
  a.  Acquire hotel booking data from Excel spreadsheets.
  b.  Create a SQL Server database and import the data.
  c.  Clean and transform the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

3. SQL Query Development:
  Write SQL queries to explore the data and identify key trends.
  Aggregate data from multiple tables to create a unified dataset.
  Calculate new fields like revenue and total nights to facilitate analysis.

5. Power BI Data Modeling and Visualization:
  Import the SQL query results into Power BI.
  Create a data model to establish relationships between tables and fields.
  Design an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights:
  Revenue Trends
  ADR Analysis
